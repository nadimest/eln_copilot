We're running a series of experiments using a 4x6 rack. Here's our setup:

Enzymes:

Enzyme Alpha will be used in the upper two rows of each rack Enzyme Beta goes in the lower two rows Compounds:

Starting from the first column, we'll alternate between Compound X and Compound Y Processes:

The left half of the rack (columns 1-3) will undergo Process Fast: 20 min at 37°C The right half (columns 4-6) will use Process Slow: 60 min at 30°C Additional notes:

We need to run each unique combination in triplicates The racks should be labeled as RACK-A , We're particularly interested in how Enzyme Alpha interacts with Compound Y under Process Slow Please set up the experiment table for the rack, ensuring all combinations are accounted for and triplicated as needed.
