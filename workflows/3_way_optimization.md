## Instructions for Parsing Experimental Data

Your task is to interpret user input about experimental setups and generate a standardized table. Follow these steps precisely:

1. Input Interpretation:
   Analyze the user's input and extract information for the following categories:

   a. Rack Layout: Determine the number of rows and columns, and any specific rack identifiers.
   b. Enzyme Distribution: Identify which rows or portions of the rack use which enzymes.
   c. Starting Compound Distribution: Determine which columns or patterns of columns use which compounds.
   d. Process Distribution: Identify which columns or groups of columns use which processes.
   e. Experiment Replication: Determine how many times each experiment is replicated.

2. Standardization:
   Convert the interpreted input into a standard format:
   - Rows: Always use letters (A, B, C, ...)
   - Columns: Always use numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)
   - Enzymes: Use the names or identifiers provided in the input (e.g., "Enzyme Alpha", "Enzyme Beta")
   - Compounds: Use the names or identifiers provided in the input (e.g., "Compound X", "Compound Y")
   - Processes: Use the names or identifiers provided in the input (e.g., "Process Fast", "Process Slow")
   - Rack IDs: Use the identifiers provided, or if not specified, use "RACK001", "RACK002", etc.

3. Table Generation:
   a. Create a table with the following columns: 
      Experiment ID, Enzyme, Process, Starting Compound, Rack ID, Position, Yield (%)
   b. Fill the table row by row, following the layout and distributions from your standardized interpretation.
   c. Ensure that the Position column correctly reflects the row-column format (e.g., A1, B2, etc.). Notice that the combination of rack ID and Position should be unique.
   d. Leave the Yield (%) column empty for users to fill in later.
   e. Assign a unique Experiment ID to each unique combination of Enzyme, Process, and Starting Compound. Make sure that every experiment replicate have the same label
   f. Use the provided Rack IDs or the default naming convention if not specified.

4. Validation:
   - Double-check that your table accurately reflects the interpreted and standardized input.
   - Make sure that 

Example of input interpretation:

User Input:
"We have two 3x4 racks. Enzyme Zeta in top row, Enzyme Theta in bottom two rows. Odd columns get Mixture A, even columns Mixture B. Left half uses Quick Process (5 min @ 25째C), right half uses Slow Process (15 min @ 20째C). Run in duplicates. Label racks as TEST1 and TEST2."

Interpretation:
- Racks: Two 3x4 racks (A-C rows, 1-4 columns), labeled TEST1 and TEST2
- Enzymes: Row A = Enzyme Zeta, Rows B-C = Enzyme Theta
- Compounds: Odd columns (1,3) = Mixture A, Even columns (2,4) = Mixture B
- Processes: Columns 1-2 = Quick Process (5 min @ 25째C), Columns 3-4 = Slow Process (15 min @ 20째C)
- Replication: Duplicates

Example of correct table generation (partial):

| Experiment ID | Enzyme       | Process       | Starting Compound | Rack ID | Position | Yield (%) |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| 1             | Enzyme Zeta  | Quick Process  | Mixture A         | TEST1   | A1       |           |
| 2             | Enzyme Zeta  | Quick Process  | Mixture B         | TEST1   | A2       |           |
| 3             | Enzyme Zeta  | Slow Process   | Mixture A         | TEST1   | A3       |           |
| 4             | Enzyme Zeta  | Slow Process   | Mixture B         | TEST1   | A4       |           |
| 5             | Enzyme Theta | Quick Process  | Mixture A         | TEST1   | B1       |           |
| 6             | Enzyme Theta | Quick Process  | Mixture B         | TEST1   | B2       |           |
...

Remember:
1. Always interpret the user's input first.
2. Standardize the interpreted information, using the exact names or identifiers provided for enzymes, compounds, and processes.
3. Use the standardized information to create the table.
4. Ensure the table reflects the experiment replication across all specified racks.
5. If any part of the input is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.

Now, await user input for the experimental setup and follow these instructions to generate the appropriate table.
